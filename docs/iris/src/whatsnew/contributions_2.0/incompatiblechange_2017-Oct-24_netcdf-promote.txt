* Deprecated FUTURE flag :attr:`iris.Future.netcdf_promote`.

* Removed deprecated behaviour that does not automatically promote NetCDF variables to cubes.
  This change means that NetCDF variables that define reference surfaces for dimensionless vertical coordinates
  will always be promoted and loaded as independent cubes.
