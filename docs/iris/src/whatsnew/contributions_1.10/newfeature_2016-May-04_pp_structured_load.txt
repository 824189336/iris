* The experimental structured Fieldsfile loader :func:`~iris.experimental.fieldsfile.load` has been extended to also load structured PP files.

  Structured loading is a streamlined operation, offering the benefit of a significantly faster loading alternative to the more generic :func:`iris.load` mechanism.

  Note that, structured loading is not an optimised wholesale replacement of :func:`iris.load`. Structured loading is restricted to input containing contiguously ordered fields for each phenomenon that repeat regularly over the same vertical levels and times. For further details, see :func:`~iris.experimental.fieldsfile.load`
