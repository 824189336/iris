* Concatenation no longer occurs when the auxilliary coordinates of the cubes
 do not match. This check is not applied to AuxCoords that span the dimension
 the concatenation is occuring along. This behaviour can be switched off by
 setting the check_aux_coords kwarg in the
 :method:`iris.cube.CubeList.concatenate` to False.
