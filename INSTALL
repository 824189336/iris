Installing
**********

Installing Iris requires you to build it from source.  The dependencies must be 
in place to suport this process.

.. _install_from_source:

Installing from source
======================

The latest  release file from `github <https://github.com/scitools/iris>
, or if you want to, obtain the latest git version.

Once you have satisfied the requirements detailed below 
you can build Iris::

  cd Iris
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install


.. _install_requirements:

Build requirements
==================

These are external packages which you will need to install before
installing Iris. 


Many of these packages are available in Linux package management systems,
such as python-numpy for Debian and Ubuntu

If you are installing dependencies with a package manager on Linux, 
you may need to install the development packages (look for a "-dev" postfix) 
in addition to the libraries themselves.


:term:`python` 2.7 (or later but not python3)
    Iris requires python 2.7 or later (`download <http://www.python.org/download/>`__)

:term:`numpy` 1.6 (or later)
    array support for python (`download
    <http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/n/numpy>`__)

Packaged Distributions
=======================

The Enthought Python Distribution `(EPD)
<http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_ for Windows, OS X or
Redhat provides some of the dependencies for Iris as does `Python (x, y)
<http://www.pythonxy.com/foreword.php>`_ which tends to be updated a
bit more frequently.
